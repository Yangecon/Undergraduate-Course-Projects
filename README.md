## Projects
### Programming Fundamentals

This folder contains my individual course project for *Programming Fundamentals* (2023-24 Academic Year), focusing on Data Cleaning and Econometric Analysis using Python.  
- `health.ipynb`: Full analysis in Jupyter Notebook format with data preprocessing, modeling, and interpretation.
- `health.pdf`: Printable version of the report.

### Others

This folder contains miscellaneous archives:
- `Paths_Mortality.py`: Generates visualizations of the pathways to check the data.
- `Paths_mortality_all.png`: Sample output from the script `Paths_Mortality.py`.

Just archiving on a whim.
